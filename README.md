The Retail Point of Sales (POS) Application demonstrates the design and implementation of CRUD (Create records, Review records, Update records and Delete records) operations to interact with the SQL server. It provides functionalities for the Admin to add products, update product pricing, and delete products from the retail inventory. The Admin can also view all products in the inventory, along with all the orders that the clients made. The Client has the capabilities to order a product from a list of products, as well as to cancel an order. The client can view a list of products for purchasing, in addition to view his/her own order history. The program checks login credentials to determine the user's role (whether admin or client) and capabilities.
